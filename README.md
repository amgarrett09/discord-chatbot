# discord-chatbot

Work in progress.

The aim here is to write a chatbot for discord in Rust, and to design it with a
user-friendly text-user-interface (TUI).

Right now it doesn't do much, but I'd like to eventually implement these
features and possibly more:

* Manage multiple discord bots in different channels
* Modify bot commands
* Activate features on command from the TUI (e.g. starting a poll or a game)
* Add and remove modules from the bot
